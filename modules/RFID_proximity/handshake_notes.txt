handshake:
device -> host:
	report id to set timestamp offset
	
host -> device:
	set timestamp offset to XXXX : uint32_t
	the timestamp offset is a rather complex value: we store the offset to use 
		when providing times to the host, as well as the value of the timer when
		that offset was received. To send a value: now() - dev_offset + host_offset
		so in fact just one value can be used: host_offset - dev_offset
