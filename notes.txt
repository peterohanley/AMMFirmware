self-test returns device serial number on success
triggered by a Get Feaure Report
do self-test before loading usb connection, stroe result
right now just return serial number
store serial number in first 8 bytes of EEPROM

TODO make document describing all the arbitrary but fixed decisions made i.e. 
static report id allocations, static EEPROM locations, and so on

collect all these notes together

for now make serial number 0xDEADBEEF

to unify all the subsytems I created make a template
	tasks that run once a loop
	global variables
	messages? maybe instead record events and have one event responder program
