new HID report "reboot now" use 255
	send the essage
	application disables USB
	application jumps to start address of boot section
	bootloader bootloads, restarts in the same way
	this will work because bootloader cannot boot reboot into bootloader voluntarily 

application sets value, rests
code in init section jumps to bootloader
bootloader overwrites application code, watchdog resets
execution continues in new application code

bootstrapping a new device:
write the annoying BOOTRST bootloader to the device
use that bootloader to load an application

stage
	empty

stage
	enable BOOTRST
	load new bootloader

stage
	load new application through new bootloader

stage
	disable BOOTRST

then create image so that this only needs to be done once

#to create an image
avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P usb -c avrispmkii -U flash:r:boot_and_app.bin:r

#to write an image
avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P usb -c avrispmkii -U flash:w:boot_and_app.bin -U lfuse:w:0x5e:m -U hfuse:w:0x99:m -U efuse:w:0xcb:m

how to check that a prospective program image is safe for uploading
use avrdude to dump flash
bootload new image
bootload old image over new image
check byte-for-byte compatibility with originally written image
this requires .hex versions of old and new code, as well as knowledge that the
	old code is on the device
