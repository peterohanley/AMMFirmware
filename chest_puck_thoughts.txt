chest intubation STM
inputs: pressure, direction, "spikiness" of pressure (variacne above threshold)

desired thing to detect: a spiky drop
	pressure down
	spikiness > some threshold

each second: check for pressure lower than f(avg. pressure over prev. second) as the pressure drop condition
	candidates for f(x) : \x -> x - 5

action: send some message

also use a pressure sensor to get atmospheric pressure
